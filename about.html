	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="img/image.jpg" align = "left">
	<p>You'd like to know about me? Alright. I guess I can tell you a little bit about myself. 
		My name is Amy Quach. I'm a fourth year student at Univeristy of California, Irvine.</p>
	<h4>What's my major? Oh hush. I was just getting to that part.<br></h4>
	<p>My major is Business Information Management. I also happen to have an Accounting minor. 
		Interesting combination isn't it?</p>
	<h4>What does my major even do? Hmm...I guess I can explain it to you.</h4>
	<p>My major is the brainchild of the school of business and the school of information and computer science. 
		Now how do those two schools relate? Well all businesses now use some form of technology. 
		I mean most businesses have a website right? They also use a database to gather information right? 
		Well my major is a mesh between the business side of a business and the technology side of a business. 
		I learn everything from finance to strategic management on the business side, and I learn to design and write code on the tech side. 
		Pretty interesting huh?</p>
	<h4>Hm? What was that? Oh. What do I do outside of school?</h4>
	<p> Well when I'm not stuck in a classroom or locked in my room doing homework and studying, I do like to read manga and watch anime. 
		I also like to watch artists on Twitch and Youtube. It's so calming to watch them create art. 
		I'm thinking of picking it back up actually. I used to draw before I got to college, but college soon got in the way of the hobby. 
		I really like to play video games too. Recently I've been playing 7th Dragon III and Fantasy Life on my 3DS. 
		I've been playing Star Wars: The Old Republic too. Sure seems like I got a lot of games going at the same time huh? 
		I just like the variety since playing one game for too long actually makes me really bored, so I like to switch it up a bit.</p>
	<h4> What~? All that isn't enough? What else do you want me to tell you?...You want me to tell you about my childhood?!...Isn't that a little too personal? *sigh* Alright alright.</h4>
	<p> I grew up in the Los Angeles Area. Lived there my entire life. Mm...I guess I was an active child. I would run after school with a team. 
		I even competed in races, but I wasn't too serious about them until I got older. 
		Biggest accomplishment is definitely finishing the Los Angeles Marathon when I was of the young age of 12. 
		Man how I wish I could still run like that. I mean it wasn't easy, but I ran 26.2 miles! 
		Think about it! That's basically running over halfway down to Irvine from Los Angeles.</p>
	<p>Mmm...I think that's all I'll tell you about myself really. 
		Don't give me that look or I'll kick you back out to that sticky web out there. 
		I'll have it that you better be glad that you got yourself out of there and found my little site. 
		Who knows what those monsters out there could of done to you.</p>
