	<h1>Welcome to Amy Quach's Personal Website</h1>
	<p>Hi there! I see you've found your way to my little website. 
		My name is Amy. Pleased to make your acquaintance! 
		I know it isn't much, but feel free to have a look around. 
		I'm sure you'll find something that'll entertain you for a bit. 
		Oh. Do mind to not touch anything you aren't suppose to. 
		We can't have anything blowing up this tiny little website now can we? 
		Anyway! Enjoy your stay here!

	<p>Oh here's a picture for you to enjoy. This was from when I went to Cambodia.</p>
