  <h2> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kkZORRR_f6Qq4ghET_IoRf3cQnSd1C2AU7Rc0I5jT4c/edit?usp=sharing">User Interviews</a></h2>
  <img src="img/User Interviews.PNG" >
  <p>User interviews were conducted to find out what users would expect when seeing a portfolio site as well as why
	they would create or use a portfolio website.</p>
  <h2> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/110LE2jz-ouUX5KgUlvbYZAa74ZkFLtjH8tzIw0aSXoc/edit?usp=sharing">Competitor Analysis</a></h2>
  <img src="img/Competitor Analysis.PNG" >
  <p>A competitor analysis is looking at and analysing another website that has a similar purpose to your own. This is
	to see what others are doing that is effective or not effective so that improvements can be made.
	  In this case, I analyzed fellow student websites.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DZwG-4VcHGemob-tl9sxjKdY-gvCtf_GMcUs2meIxYc/edit?usp=sharing">Feature Value Matrix</a></h2>
  <img src="img/Feature Value Matrix.PNG" >
  <p>A feature value matrix is matrix that lists the features included in a website, like resume or email address, and rates how 
	important these are to the user, to the business, and how much development effort is needed to implement the feature. 
	The features I have in this matrix are those that are on my website already and those that I feel would be nice to 
	add on after the basic website is running.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13bboFRWj0JtgKMXy99hJAZ0D6YDWW9Cyk9iNjugO7IY/edit?usp=sharing">Feature Prioritization</a></h2>
  <img src="img/Feature Prioritization.PNG" >
  <p>I prioritized my features by what would be the basic things needed in a working website. Anything after what is basically needed 
	such as an about page with a short bio and a form of contact, it can be added later on as it isn't needed in the 
	minimal viable product.</p>

  <h1>User Testing</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Shkd-PYS_J7aiuVWJ4bb-OWQjf1z8Xp35tlVAgB4aw/edit?usp=sharing">User Stories</a></h2>
  <img src="img/User Stories.PNG">
  <p>User stories are important as they tell you what a specific type of user would do to look for on the website and why 
	they would look on the website in the first place. It also tells you what kind of event should happen for the user 
	to deem that they were successful in their search.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140jg7gq-UF2GrKWL9BluvD_aW5Fob5Wqmn3tTE3Ti2k/edit#gid=0">Cognitive Walkthrough</a></h2>
  <img src="img/Cognitive Walkthrough.PNG">
  <p>A cognitive walkthrough is having users perform certain tasks on the website while asking them questions along the way. 
	This is to find any design flaws that could possibly hinder a user's experience when using the website. I particularly 
	had a simple website so the cognitive walkthroughs didn't give me too much information.</p>
  <h2>User Test</h2>
  <img src="img/User Test.PNG">
  <p>The two tests I used were a questions test and a 5 second test. These were chosen as they are more qualitative tests and 
	can provide insight on how my website is laid out and if it is effective for users. I found that in the 5 second test 
	a lot of users thought that this website was a travel website instead of a professional website due to the content of 
	the screenshot they saw. In the question test, I found that how I laid out my About page was not easy for users to 
	read the content on the page due to spacing.</p>

  <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Overall, I feel that I received the most information when I did my user testing phase for my website. During the user research phase, 
	I found that a lot of the users that I asked to participate, both professionals and students, answered in the same way. 
	The answers were for a very basic website that had a bio page, contact page, and some projects or skills, which didn't 
	provide me with much insight on how I can change my website since it was already very basic in layout.</p>
  <p>During my user testing, it became more clear in what I could do to improve my website. Users were getting their hands on my website 
	  and had the ability to use the website. Many expressed that on a first impression they thought the website was something 
	  about travel or was a blog. This indicated to me that I would need to make an adjustment to the content of the pages 
	  and the presentation of the content to make it seem more like a professional website. Others pointed out that the spacing 
	  on the About page between the image and the written content could be bigger so that it was easier to read.</p>

<div>
  <h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I think the biggest thing to change on the website right now is the content. I feel that this will need some more iterations 
	  as I would need to go back and test with users again to see if the content is more fitting for what I want to portray 
	  my website as.</p>
  <p> Another feature that might take me some time would to make my email address a mailto link and find a way to filter what comes in so that 
	  I don't get sent a lot of spam messages.</p>
  <p>For quick minor changes, I can adjust the spacing of my content as well as test with other color combinations so that my website 
	  isn't so harsh on users' eyes.</p>
